    "#### Target (y)\n",
    "- Attrition (Binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "- To apply Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Algorithms on the given dataset and understand the concepts of Underfitting and Overfitting and ways to combat these problems. There are three sections -\n",
    "- Section 1 \n",
    "    - Visualization of Overfitting and Underfitting (with results on cross validation)\n",
    "- Section 2\n",
    "    - Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "- Download and load the data (csv file)\n",
    "- Process the data according to guidelines given in the comments of the respective cells.\n",
    "- Split the dataset into 60% for training and rest 40% for testing (sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split function)\n",
    "- Initialize Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Models (With parameters given in the cell)\n",
    "- Train the models on the same dataset\n",
    "- Complete Section 1 and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Fun (will not be evaluated)\n",
    "- Train model on different train-test splits such as 60-40, 50-50, 70-30, 80-20, 90-10, 95-5 etc. and observe the respective plots and results on both X_train and X_test\n",
    "- Shuffle training samples with different random seed values in the train_test_split function. Check the model error for the testing data for each setup.\n",
    "- Explore ways to deal with imbalanced dataset. Use different methods (such as eliminating outliers and such) to experiment with the given dataset.\n",
